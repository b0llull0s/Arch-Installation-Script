## Installation:

- Make sure you have a `USB` ready to use with a verified Arch `ISO`
- You can use `rufus` or `dd` command in linux:
```bash
# Lookup for your USB drive
sudo fdisk -l
# Lookup for the path of your ISO file
realpath isofile
# Create the bootable USB
sudo dd bs=4M if=/home/shutter/Documents/ISOs/archlinux-2023.10.14-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdb
```
- Once you booted the `USB` and accessed the Arch `ISO` you may need to connect to your `wifi`
```bash
# Start iwctl
iwctl
# list devices
device list
# Interface set to scan
station wlan0 scan
# Scan for networks
station wlan0 get-networks
# Connect to a network
station wlan0 connect networkname
```
- First, update the `keyring` to avoid issues:
```
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```
- Just run the `archinstall` script. This are the only relevant steps that you need to follow for this build:
  - Use `ext4` file type for your system.
  - `Systemd-bootloader` can give you problems with encryptation, in that case just use `GRUB`
  - Choose `NetworkManager`
  - Extra libraries for `32bit` support.
  - Once is done reboot your system.
  
- Edit `pacman.conf`
```bash
nano /etc/pacman.conf
# Uncoment Color
# Set ParallelDownloads = 5
# Add "ILoveCandy"
```
- Now you should need to connect to the internet, this time use `NetworkManager` from your system:
```bash
# Check if Networkmanager is running
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager.service
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
# Connect to wifi
nmcli device wifi list
nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password password
# Different interface
nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password password ifname wlan1 profile_name
# Hidden network
nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password password hidden yes
```
- And download this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/b0llull0s/Arch-Installation-Script.git
```
- Some application doesnt accept relatives paths and you will have to change those to your own home folder.
- You may also want to create a new directory with your desired profile name on `Wireshark/profile` and move the files inside.
- You may want to add your wallpapers to the `w4llp4p3rs` folder or just change the name and path on the script as you want.
- If you experience problems with `py-wal`, make sure that all the paths inside the config files match with your system files.
### Yubikey:
- To integrate your `yubikey` for passwordless sudo:
```bash
# Introduce this command, if it generates a hash is all good
pamu2fcfg
# Create the directory for the config files
mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico
# Now register the hash in the config file
pamu2fcfg -o pam://me -i pam://me > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
```
- Now configure `PAM`. 
> [!CAUTION]
> **Don't close the `PAM` file until you make it work if you want to avoid pain!!!**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sudo
```
- Make sure the file looks like this:
```bash
#%PAM-1.0
account         include         system-auth
session         include         system-auth
auth            sufficient      pam_u2f.so cue origin=pam://me appid=pam://me
```
- Without closing the `PAM` file test to see if it works:
```bash
sudo echo "SUCCESS"
```
### AppArmor:
- Add the kernel parameters to your bootloader:
```bash
# For GRUB:
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
# Edit this line so it looks like this:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,apparmor,bpf"
# Now run this command:
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# Enable the service:
sudo systemctl enable apparmor.service
# Reboot your system and check if AppArmor enabled:
aa-enabled
# Now parse the profiles
sudo apparmor_parser /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles
```

## Tips:

- Sometimes you may enconter an error retrieving the `blackarch.db` while updating the system, this error is normally related to a mirror having an expired certificate, simply comment that mirror and uncomment another one
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/blackarch-mirrorlist
``` 
- In case you need to generate a new `py-wal` template just use the alias `walup`:
```bash
# For a specific file
wal -i ~/Downloads/w4llp4p3rs/1.jpg
```
- In case you need to make zsh your default shell:
```bash
usermod --shell /usr/bin/zsh username
```
- Refresh your system data base:
```bash
sudo updatedb
``` 
- To implement plugings use locate to find the path of the plugin file and add it to your source file:
```bash
# use this command:
locate zsh-autosuggestions
# Copy the .zsh entry and add it as source in the config file:
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```
- Type `alias`to check the list of aliases.
- Nowdays with `Steam` using `proton` you dont need to install the `graphical drivers` yourself, the correct drivers for your system will be install when installing `proton` from `Steam`.
- Use `atool` to compress and uncompress files, worth to have a look at the `Arch Manual pages`.
- Once you have apparmor ready you may want to have a look to the `snap store`.
- I dont use `xwayland` but in case you do, the `env` paths are commented on `hyprland.conf`.
- At some point your pacman cache may grow more than it should, clear old libraries and cache to release space
```sh
sudo pacman -Scc
```
- You can also use this command to delete core dump files
```sh
find / -xdev -name core -ls -o  -path "/lib*" -prune
```
> [!CAUTION]
>- Currently Virtualbox Can't Use Fullscreen Mode On Wayland by default.
>- To fix this, go to "User Interface" on the "Settings" from your VM and uncheck "Show in Full-screen/Seamless".
>- This shoud fix the issue, after just adapt the display resolution inside the VM to match the size you are using with your compositor.
